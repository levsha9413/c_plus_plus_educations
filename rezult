Opens the file identified by argument filename, associating it with the stream object, so that input/output operations are performed on its content. Argument mode specifies the opening mode.

If the stream is already associated with a file (i.e., it is already open), calling this function fails.

The file association of a stream is kept by its internal stream buffer:
Internally, the function calls rdbuf()->open(filename,mode|ios_base::out)
